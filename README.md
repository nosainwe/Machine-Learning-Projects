Project Descriptions
This repository contains machine learning projects focusing on classification problems across various domains, from fraud detection and spam filtering to network security. Each project employs data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, with an emphasis on accuracy and robustness.

Project 1: Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning
Description: This project tackles the detection of fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning models. The objective is to accurately classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent to aid in early fraud detection.
Key Features:
Data preprocessing techniques, including handling class imbalance.
Model training and evaluation using methods like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Performance metrics including F1 Score and Precision-Recall curves for assessing model effectiveness on imbalanced data.
Project 2: Spam Email Classifier using Machine Learning
Description: This project involves building a spam email classifier to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails. The project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to process text data and create effective features for classification.
Key Features:
Text preprocessing and feature extraction using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and N-grams.
Implementation of machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine, for classification.
Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
Project 3: DDoS Attack Classification using Machine Learning
Description: This project focuses on classifying Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using machine learning techniques to enhance network security. The IDS 2017 dataset is used for training and testing models to identify malicious network traffic.
Key Features:
Data exploration and preprocessing to prepare network traffic data for analysis.
Application of various machine learning models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks.
Model evaluation using accuracy, F1 score, recall, and ROC-AUC to ensure reliability in detecting DDoS attacks.
Each project is implemented in Jupyter Notebooks and demonstrates best practices in data preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation.
