# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project! This project aims to identify fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. By analyzing transaction data, we can help reduce the risk of fraud and protect consumers.

## Technologies Used
This project utilizes the following libraries:
- NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- The dataset was gotten from Kaggle

## Installation
To get started, ensure you have the following libraries installed. You can install them using pip:


bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn




## Usage
1. Load the Data: Use Pandas to load your transaction dataset.
2. Preprocess the Data: Clean and prepare your data for analysis.
3. Split the Data: Use
train_test_split
from Scikit-learn to divide your data into training and testing sets.
4. Train the Model: Implement a Logistic Regression model to classify transactions.
5. Evaluate the Model: Use
accuracy_score
to assess the performance of your model.

### Example Code
Hereâ€™s a brief example of how to implement the model:


python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data/transactions.csv')

# Preprocess the data (this is just a placeholder)
# X, y = preprocess_data(data)

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
