Project Descriptions
This repository contains machine learning projects focusing on classification problems across various domains, from fraud detection and spam filtering to network security. Each project employs data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, with an emphasis on accuracy and robustness.

Project 1: Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning
Description: This project tackles the detection of fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning models. The objective is to accurately classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent to aid in early fraud detection.

Key Features:
Data preprocessing techniques, including handling class imbalance.
Model training and evaluation using methods like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Performance metrics including F1 Score and Precision-Recall curves for assessing model effectiveness on imbalanced data.

Project 2: Spam Email Classifier using Machine Learning

Description: This project involves building a spam email classifier to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails. The project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to process text data and create effective features for classification.

Key Features:
Text preprocessing and feature extraction using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and N-grams.
Implementation of machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine, for classification.
Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

Project 3: DDoS Attack Classification using Machine Learning
Description: This project focuses on classifying Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using machine learning techniques to enhance network security. The IDS 2017 dataset is used for training and testing models to identify malicious network traffic.

Key Features:
Data exploration and preprocessing to prepare network traffic data for analysis.
Application of various machine learning models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks.
Model evaluation using accuracy, F1 score, recall, and ROC-AUC to ensure reliability in detecting DDoS attacks.
Each project is implemented in Jupyter Notebooks or Google Collab and demonstrates best practices in data preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation.

Project 4 : Implement URL phishing detection with Logistic Regression and TF-IDF vectorization
Description: This project aims to classify URLs as either "legitimate" or "phishing" using machine learning. The project utilizes a logistic regression model, trained on a dataset of URLs, and applies the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization technique to convert the URLs into numerical features for analysis. By cleaning and preprocessing the URLs, the model can differentiate between harmful phishing sites and trusted, legitimate websites. The project reads a dataset of URLs from a CSV file, splits the data into training and test sets, and evaluates the model's performance. The final trained model and the corresponding URL vectorizer are saved using pickle for later use in making predictions.

Key Features:
The project features a robust URL classification system that preprocesses and cleans URLs by removing unwanted parts and non-alphanumeric characters, using a custom tokenizer. It then transforms the cleaned URLs into numerical feature vectors through TF-IDF vectorization, enabling the classification of URLs as legitimate or phishing. The system utilizes a logistic regression model for training and classification, with an evaluation step to assess the model's performance. Additionally, it saves the trained model and vectorizer for future use, allowing for the classification of new URLs without retraining the model.
