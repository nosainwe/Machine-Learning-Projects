  <h1>Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 2017 Dataset Project</h1>
  <p>This project focuses on analyzing the IDS 2017 dataset to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting network intrusions. By identifying malicious network activities, the model can help enhance cybersecurity measures in modern networks. This project includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance comparison of different machine learning algorithms.</p>

  <h2>Project Workflow</h2>
  <p>This README will guide you through each phase of the project. Below is a breakdown of each step involved in creating a successful intrusion detection system.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Importing Libraries</strong>
      <p>Libraries are essential tools that provide pre-written functions to handle data analysis, modeling, and visualization. In this project, we use libraries such as pandas for data handling, NumPy for numerical operations, and scikit-learn for machine learning models.</p>
      <pre><code>import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score, precision_score, recall_score, confusion_matrix</code></pre>
    </li>

   <li><strong>Data Pre-processing</strong>
      <p>Data preprocessing is the process of cleaning and transforming raw data into a format suitable for modeling. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numeric data. For this project, we load the IDS 2017 dataset and clean it to remove any null values, ensuring it is ready for analysis.</p>
      <pre><code>df = pd.read_csv('/content/DDos.csv')
# Dropping rows with null values
df.dropna(inplace=True)</code></pre>
    </li>

  <li><strong>Data Exploration</strong>
      <p>Data exploration involves understanding the properties of the dataset, identifying patterns, and visualizing distributions. This helps in uncovering insights about each feature, which can be useful when selecting which features to use in the model. Descriptive statistics and visualizations are key methods used in this step.</p>
      <pre><code>df.describe()</code></pre>
    </li>

   <li><strong>Data Splitting</strong>
      <p>We split the dataset into two sets: training and testing sets. The training set is used to fit the machine learning model, while the testing set evaluates the model's performance. This process helps us understand how the model generalizes to new, unseen data. A typical split is 80% for training and 20% for testing.</p>
      <pre><code>X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)</code></pre>
    </li>

  <li><strong>Feature Scaling</strong>
      <p>Feature scaling standardizes the features, bringing all values into a similar range. This step improves model performance, especially for algorithms like Neural Networks. Scaling is done by normalizing data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.</p>
      <pre><code>scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)</code></pre>
    </li>

   <li><strong>Model Training</strong>
      <p>Model training involves using algorithms to learn from the training data. In this project, we use three models:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Random Forest</strong>: A versatile model that builds multiple decision trees and merges them for a robust prediction.</li>
        <li><strong>Logistic Regression</strong>: A linear model effective for binary classification tasks, predicting whether traffic is normal or an intrusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Neural Network</strong>: A powerful model that learns complex patterns in data, though it requires more computational power.</li>
      </ul>
      <pre><code>model_rf = RandomForestClassifier().fit(X_train, y_train)
model_lr = LogisticRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)
model_nn = MLPClassifier().fit(X_train, y_train)</code></pre>
    </li>

   <li><strong>Model Evaluation</strong>
      <p>Model evaluation is the process of assessing how well the trained model performs on the test data. We use several metrics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: The percentage of correct predictions.</li>
        <li><strong>F1 Score</strong>: A balanced metric that considers both precision and recall.</li>
        <li><strong>Precision</strong>: The ratio of true positives to all positive predictions, showing the accuracy of positive predictions.</li>
        <li><strong>Recall</strong>: The ratio of true positives to all actual positives, indicating the model's sensitivity to detecting intrusions.</li>
      </ul>
      <pre><code>accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)</code></pre>
    </li>

  <li><strong>Model Comparison</strong>
      <p>After evaluating each model, compare their performances based on the metrics. This helps in selecting the best model for deployment in intrusion detection. The ideal model will have high scores across all metrics, indicating both accuracy and reliability in detecting intrusions.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>The following packages are required to run this project:</p>

  <h2>Dataset</h2>
  <p>The IDS 2017 dataset, used for this project, is publicly available and can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/IDS2017.html">University of New Brunswick</a> website. This dataset provides a rich source of network traffic data suitable for training intrusion detection models.</p>

  <h2>Running the Project</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone or download this repository to your local machine.</li>
    <li>Ensure you have the required libraries installed using the following command:</li>
      <pre><code>pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn</code></pre>
    <li>Run each section of the project as outlined above, in the same order.</li>
    <li>Analyze the results and determine the best model based on evaluation metrics.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>At the end of the project, the evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall) are compared for each model. The model with the best performance is considered optimal for detecting network intrusions.</p>
